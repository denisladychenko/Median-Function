# Median-Function
Determines the median of the sorted array

In statistics the median of the set of values is the value that lies in the middle when the values are arranged in sorted order. If the set has and even number of values, then the median is taken to be the average of the two middle values. Write a function that determines the median of a sorted array. The function should take an array of numbers and an integer indicating the size of the array and return the median of the values in the array. You may assume the array is already sorted. Use pointer notation whenever possible.
